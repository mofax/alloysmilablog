What is Vission?

A company vision is a broad statement that describes what an organization wants to achieve or accomplish in the long term. It helps guide the decisions and actions of the company. Some key characteristics of a good company vision include:

• It's inspiring and motivational. A vision should energize and motivate the people in the organization and stakeholders.

• It's forward-looking. A vision typically describes what the organization wants to become in the future, not what it is today. It's aspirational.

• It's broad and abstract. A vision is not meant to be concrete or measurable. It provides a broad sense of purpose and direction.

• It's enduring. A vision should guide the company for the long term, not just the short term. It serves as a compass for the organization.

• It's rooted in core values. A vision should reflect the core values and purpose of the organization. It shapes the culture and priorities.

• It's achievable but ambitious. While a vision is meant to inspire, it should also be pragmatic and possible to work toward achieving. It should stretch the organization without seeming unrealistic.

• It's broadly communicated. An effective vision helps align and guide the entire organization. It's communicated clearly and frequently to all employees and key stakeholders.

• It's reviewed and revisited. Visions can evolve over time. Regular reviews help ensure the vision continues to inspire, guide key decisions, and reflect the core purpose of the organization.
