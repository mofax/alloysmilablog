The AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. It has a height-balancing property by associating each node with a balance factor. The balance factor is calculated by the formula: Balance Factor = Height Of Left Subtree - Height Of Right Subtree. The balance factor can be either -1, 0, or +1.

The AVL tree can perform certain operations in logarithmic time. It controls the height of the binary search tree and prevents it from becoming skewed. When a binary tree becomes skewed, it's the worst case (O (n)) for all operations. By using the balance factor, the AVL tree imposes a limit on the binary tree and keeps all operations at O (log n).
The AVL tree got its name after its inventors, Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Landis.



Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the AVL algorithm works:

1. Binary Tree Structure: The AVL algorithm starts with a binary search tree structure where each node contains a value and has left and right child pointers (which can be null).

2. Node Height: Each node in the AVL tree maintains a balance factor and a height. The height of a node is the maximum height of its left and right subtrees, plus 1. It represents the length of the longest path from the node to a leaf.

3. Insertion: When inserting a new node into the AVL tree, the algorithm performs a standard binary search tree insertion. After insertion, it checks the balance factor of each node along the insertion path.

4. Balance Factor: The balance factor of a node is calculated as the height of its left subtree minus the height of its right subtree. It can be -1, 0, or 1 for a node to be considered balanced. If the balance factor exceeds this range, the tree needs rebalancing.

5. Rebalancing: If the balance factor of a node violates the balance condition, the AVL algorithm performs rotations to restore balance. There are four types of rotations: left-rotation, right-rotation, left-right rotation, and right-left rotation.

   - Left Rotation: When a node becomes unbalanced with a positive balance factor (left heavy), a left rotation is performed. This helps restructure the tree and maintain balance.

   - Right Rotation: When a node becomes unbalanced with a negative balance factor (right heavy), a right rotation is performed. This also helps restructure the tree and preserve balance.

   - Left-Right Rotation: A left-right rotation is performed when a node's left child has a negative balance factor. It involves rotating first to the left and then to the right.

   - Right-Left Rotation: A right-left rotation is performed when a node's right child has a positive balance factor. It involves rotating first to the right and then to the left.

   These rotations adjust the positions of nodes while preserving the order of values, ultimately ensuring that the tree remains balanced.

6. Updating Heights: After performing rotations, the algorithm updates the height of the nodes affected by the insertion and rotation. This update propagates up the tree, ensuring that all nodes have the correct height.

7. Efficiency: The AVL algorithm maintains a balanced binary tree; therefore, the height of the tree remains logarithmic in the number of nodes. This ensures efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations with a time complexity of O(log n).

The AVL algorithm guarantees a balance factor of -1, 0, or 1 for every node in the tree, resulting in optimal performance for common tree operations.
